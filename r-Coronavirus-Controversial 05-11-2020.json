        "Text": "So the virus is contagious (by almost all reports) for 14 days. So my question is, why don't we shut down everything for 14 days. And I mean EVERYTHING.\nNobody (in the developed world) should be allowed to leave their house. No flights. No school. No business. Nothing. Everybody at home. The only people allowed out could be (previously tested) military personnel. \nIn theory this thing should be over with in 2 weeks time.\nI know this would demand a lot of planning and coordinating and would probably cause an increase in deaths by the currently infected - but I argue that this would be smarter than the half hearted effort we are doing now, which probably has to last until there is a vaccine - meaning 1 year!\nSo even if in those 2 weeks 1.500 people die (half of the infected population outside of China). It would be much lower than what we probably going to see in a year from now.\nYou thoughts?"

        "Text": "The recent novel Coronavirus outbreak has drawn greater attention from the public worldwide. Many are shocked by the sensational topic of \"eating wild animals (chi ye wei)\" as it is assumed to be one of the causes of nCoV, which leads to misunderstandings and insult to people from Asia, especially the primary victim of this disaster, Chinese people.\n\nA video about one Chinese female having bat soup hit the Internet recently. No matter how others feel about it, my Chinese friends and I felt sick after watching it. But what hurts us most are the unreasonable misunderstandings and insult to Asian people, especially Chinese people. Angry and upset, I determined to find out who likes bat soup particularly and why they would like to consume it.\n\nI get started from the bat soup video. With efforts from Chinese netizens, we found that the female protagonist of the video had that soup in Palau, a Pacific island country. And that soup it a speciality there. What is more, many other Southeast Asian countries have the tradition of eating bats. I am not gonna distract the public attention from China to any other countries or regions, it's definitely unfair, but I need to make the background of that hot video clear. Then, who likes bats in China?\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nAs far as I know, the documented history of eating bat can be dated back to the 9th century. But bats are always looked down upon as low-status dishes and only the starving poor have to rely on it for living. Time passes, PRC has set up severe laws and regulations against illegal wildlife hunting and consumption. Thus, the bat is refused by most Chinese people, mentally and legally.\n\nSo why would some people take the risks and consume bat? For some, eating bats is just a short cut to attract attention. Sometimes, it's even TV program needs, like Bear Grylls ate bats in Man VS. Wild in 2009 or K-pop star ate bats in a wilderness survival TV show. On the other hand, some may eat bats simply out of curiosity. I bet you must have watched or heard much more disgusting scene on YouTube or any other social media channels.\n\nThat is to say, eating bat exists everywhere in the world and only a few people eat it. It is unfair or unreasonable to blame a nation, a country or an area for the anomaly.\n\nNow, with a bombardment of false accusations from the internet trolls, Chinese cuisine is misrepresented like the this.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nHowever, it is not the truth. In fact, considering its long history, Chinese food has a richness and a heritage, which can be classified from different perspectives like times and techniques, regions and ethnics, folkways and functions, etc. Various flavours and edible values could be found in Chinese food. So the real Chinese cuisine is like this:\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nThe list goes on and on... Anyway, those are actually what we Chinese eat every day. As for bats and civets, most Chinese even dare not to look at them, not to mention to eat them!\n\nIn brief, eating wild animals not only makes us sick but also is likely to spread diseases. We Chinese, together with people around the world, would fight against those terrible behaviours.\n\nHowever, some people's heart is more horrible than the virus. When everyone is united against the virus, some individuals are trying to defame China by twisting the facts, which is childish and shameful.\n\nI hope that upon arrival of spring, the epidemic would have been over. At that time, we could go to see cherry blossom after enjoying Wuhan dry noodles as usual."

        "Text": "There could be at least 3 latent stages to Covid-19. It's these quiet stages that lull us into a false sense of security. \n\nNote, reinfection isn't scientifically proven yet. The main evidence is from doctors in China who've made that conjecture. The closest discussion I've seen on this was here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/f67fan/reinfection_with_same_strain_producing_severe/\nBut it needed better references from the OP for that evidence based thread. \n\nSo, take this with a grain of salt and comment if there's evidence for and against anything here. Remember that this is just discussion at this stage. \n\n\n//Please help me to update this post with TBC (To be completed) sections and references to the secondary infection paper and latency evidence. I'll go back through my research and try to update references after work but if you have a reference please let me know. There are other [subreddits](https://reddit.com/r/practicalcoronavirus) that have different focusses on this virus to investigate.// \n\n&#x200B;\n\nStage 1) You first get infected. You might get mild symptoms in your respiratory tract. Maybe a sore throat. Maybe a dry cough. Some people get it worse at this stage but 80-90% walk it off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuggested transmission scenarios at this point: You cough into your hand. You handle cash, passing droplets onto it. The cashier takes your cash. Person receiving money is wearing a mask but wipes sleepy dust away from their eye and gets infected. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is now a large window that lulls us into a false sense of security. We think this lasts for \\*TBC\\* days on average. Anal swabs at this point might not detect much. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nStage 2) Your immune system fights off the infection in the upper part of your body. The virus moves to the lower part. It's infecting ACE2 but it's new reservior is the gastrointestinal tract. You get mild diarroea. It smells bad but you don't really mind. You've had Bali belly before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSuggested transmission [scenario](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXelEi4tqAo&feature=youtu.be) at this [point](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/32065057/?i=4&from=coronavirus): You flush a squat toilet with no lid. As evidenced by the smell, there's a chance of droplets and even [aeroisation](https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-019-3707-y). The virus lands on surfaces like the toilet door handle in a public bathroom and a toothbrush at home. It travels through a drainage pipe as we saw with SARS in Hong Kong. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nStage 3) You recover without any assistance. You still have some of the virus left in key ACE2 receptor areas of your body but you're slowly flushing it out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nStage 4) Now your antibodies reduce. This is key. There is now a lag time to the next stage. You're uninfected but vulnerable. How long this lasts is anyone's guess. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStage 5) You get reinfected. But this time the virus is \\*\\*\\*slightly different\\*\\*\\*. The body produces the same antibodies as before but this time this only makes things worse by assisting the virus to enter even immune cells. As with Dengue, everyone's immune system is different. This is where having a strong immune system could be a problem. In some people's bodies more and more of the same is produced forming a Cytokine storm. The immune system is damaging your own body. \n\nAt this stage you need something to suppress that immune system. You need oxygen. And you also need something to treat the virus since your immune system is attacking it as if it were like the previous infection. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be clear, at this point your live or die shopping list is:\n\n\\- oxygen\n\n\\- an [antiviral](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0282-0?fbclid=IwAR1DeWaS1w2LD3MrW). [There](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.05.936013v1) are >100 in trials\n\n\\- an \\*\\*[immune suppressant](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202002/15/WS5e47c280a310128217277ca0.html).\\*\\* This seems key. Perhaps different immune suppressants act in different ways. AFAIK this is a key area right now in China. It's an area we don't really hear about\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSymptoms progress much faster in stage 5. Sites of the body with ACE2 are most vulnerable. These sites are: kidneys, lungs, heart, testes, eyes, TBC\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStage 6) The immune system is busy fighting the infection. You get another infection. Could be TB. Could be just a common cold. But this secondary infection is the final knockout. Doctors have been prescribing antibiotics to prevent this before any other infection is even detected. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLess specialist things that might also help at this stage could be:\n\n\\- cleaning the lungs. Don't lie flat with neumonia. Inhalable antiviral?\n\n\\- cleaning the digestive system. Antibiotic to prevent further infection? Very strong probiotics? Assist a weak patient to poo? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo get a handle on this virus I we need to think in terms of:\n\n1) reservoir areas of the lungs and digestive system, especially in terms of testing. THERE'S MORE THAN ONE AREA OF INFECTION\n\n2) Latent stages. THERE'S MORE THAN ONE STAGE.\n\n3) [Reinfection](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/comments/f5jxlf/in_epidemiology_how_would_reinfections_be/) and multi variants. THERE'S MORE THAN ONE VIRUS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is why China is experiencing meltdown right now. The genetic theory that maybe it affects Asians more is partially disproven in a [preprint paper.](https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202002.0258/v1/download) The only reason outside China is OK right now is the MANY lag periods, which no one is accounting for. Cases from the cruise ships and outside China are now pointing to exponential spread and if non Chinese react as we think then the 2nd infection knock out will be just as bad as China. We've seen some evidence for this in places outside of China now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLink to protein folding donation: [https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/)"

We give a shit about our lives and our loved ones. ITS TIME TO FUCKIN PANIC. ...we'll relax later-on and have a better *overall* experience."

        "Text": "[NTTData temp worker in his 20s tested positive](https://www.nttdata.com/jp/ja/news/information/2020/021400/).  He did an AMA on 2chan on the 14th ([summary site](http://world-fusigi.net/archives/9567927.html)). Though unverified, it sounds pretty authentic. According to the AMA, he had 104F fever for a week that he couldn't bring down with any meds, and had to go to 4 clinics and hospitals until he could convince a doctor to push its local health department to test him. One clinic made him wait in the public waiting room for 5 hours.  He also commuted from Chiba to Tokyo using 2 train lines before his fever broke, and attended 3-, and 5-hour meetings with many participants.  Now he is hospitalized and his fever is finally coming down, but if he moved he'd have a coughing fit so terrible that he's afraid of going to the bathroom. I'm shocked that the symptoms are so bad for someone so young.\n\n[Another patient in his 50s in Hokkaido is now in ICU](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20200214/k10012286451000.html) and he had to go to 3 clinics till he was able to get tested.\n\nMeanwhile, a hospital in Wakayama has 2 doctors and 1 patient tested positive so far, and [the patient in his 70s](https://www.fnn.jp/posts/2020021418545807KTV) is in too dire a condition that he cannot even be interviewed for the officials to find out who he had been in contact with.  Oh, and one of the doctors kept seeing patients while he had fever for 3 days.\n\nAlso, very nonchalantly the government told the press that[ 9 people from the Diamond Princess Cruise](https://www.fnn.jp/posts/00432139CX/202002140613_CX_CX) are now in serious/critical condition (one of the 9 has not been tested for coronavirus yet. There is another patient (IIRC it was an American elderly woman) in serious condition but they had a heart attack.\n\nMeanwhile, there will be Tokyo Marathon on March 1st. 35,000 runners have registered.  [The committee had a meeting](https://headlines.yahoo.co.jp/hl?a=20200214-00000062-dal-spo) on the 14th and decided they would not cancel, and just changed the way they'd give out bananas to the runners from cut pieces to unpeeled whole fruit.  I'm not kidding.\n\nI'm starting to think the Japanese government may be doing (or not doing) all of these things on purpose to decrease the elderly population to lighten their future financial/societal burden of rapidly aging society."

The more human there is the more fierce this mecanism is. Hoping this is not too late for the earth. The earth is coughing and is getting fever since a while now. The human virus is a deadly one. Affecting the microbiome of the earth, disrupting it's breathing and the circulation of it's water blood. The earth might not be able to get rid of all the human viruses, but it may be capable of managing it's effect by controlling the number of human virus bodies. I know it is an analogy, but if you think about the natural mecanisms in place, it does make a lot of senses. I just hope the earth is not working on a vaccine against the human virus."

Murrica greatest, all other countries awful. I dont want to suggest, that there are not Europeans or other non Murricans, who are highly Sinophobe or Xenophobe. I am from Europe (hence the bad English), we have a deal of those ppl too, but the Murricans are so exegarrating.\n\nDespite the mega effort the Chinese are putting into this outbreak, they fucking build a hospital in 10 days with 1000 beds - live on stream, so many reddit people still prey on the Chinese. It is disgusting.\n\nI have some friends in China, and some from Wuhan. I have been to Wuhan myself and it is a very nice and interesting and busy city. Now they are all super worried, and most of them just stay at home, from own motivation. Yes, there are blockades in the street, but they mostly dont need it. And yes, they are controlling people everywhere, but this is a necessary prevention from making it worse. And NO there is not a simple \"we delete everything related to this virus\" thing, and NO, phone lines are NOT getting disconnected, if you talk bad about China, the Chinese government. And NO my friends have not been arrested in the last years, for doing so.... It is TRUE, there is certain censorship there, but this is also happening in Europe. Total surveillance? Hello NSA. MI6. FSB. BND.\n\nThe govenment has not dealt accordingly at the beginning: YES MAYBE!! So WHAT!? Mistakes were made, they make up for it NOW! Conspiracy with death tolls, or reported numbers, Jesus, are you listening to yourself? There are people DYING! Relatives, uncles, grandfathers of someone who will be dearly missed! It is not for certain how people really died of Coronavirus, or not, some in other countries seem to have NO symptoms AT ALL!!! If you do not have 100% proof, or a solid source at least, most of the stuff is made up, or clickbait, or worse: Sinophobia!\n\nWUHAN is a 11 Mio. ppl city FFS. Not a village. Meaning, people die of all kind of things statisticly. Not every video is automaticaly related to this virus. If there is a video from someone lying in the street, or in a hospital: Is he REALLY dead, or just knocked out, batshit drunk, or sleeping. Is it REALLY the virus, or \"just\" a heart attack or something  similar severe? You do not know. So dont i. But projecting everything on the virus, and how possibly awful it is dealt with, is pure speculation, mostly clickbait, and mostly projected prejudice against the Chinese.\n\nAsk yourself: What would your country look like, if it got hit by the outbreak? Very similar or worse: Overcrowded hospitals, all the super entitled Karens and Rimjob\\_Steves. Mentally challenged people running around with megaphones praising end of world and to repent. Mask prices skyrocketing due to Latestagecapitalism. And so on. (To give an example for masks, a shop owner in China got sued over extortion high prices for masks...). Probably, and ESPECIALLY in Murrica, ppl will just die of it, since the lack of health insurance, instead of depressing hospital bill dept, they chose to die.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor all who are not convinced that things run mostly smoothely in other parts of China, please watch this video, look at the infrasturucture, supermarket, car quality, street quality and whatnot, but mostly LISTEN:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ex3h8t/ignore\\_the\\_clickbait\\_quite\\_an\\_insightful/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/ex3h8t/ignore_the_clickbait_quite_an_insightful/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like to pick up an argument he said: \"Because they eat strange things, doenst mean it is bad. We had the Swine flue, and mad cow desease, so we dont ban those. Only because it is things we dont know, it is automatically bad\". Some may say i have pink glasses, some might say fuck this guy, i just want you to rethink your perspective, and research more of this country.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoy0jeuqkLU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoy0jeuqkLU)"

Atleast in my experience every state i have been too you can go to urgent care/emergency room with 0$ and be seen without spending a penny.\n\nYes you will be called/mailed/harassed for the bill and you will eventually have to pay it or face repercussions. But you will be seen, get treated and hopefully be in the clear (i dont think they even can test here yet)\n\nAnyway this is not a post from someone who claims to know anything. This is a post from a concerned citizen/neighbour who has seen a few people say \"i cant even go to a dr even if im sick\" so i felt i needed to post this. It might help 0 people or 200 but i just had to get it out here because i have seen way to many people talking about there health insurance and what thry will even be able to do if you get sick\n\nEDIT: i guess i got a few things wrong and was confused. Upon thinking and reading what i wrote i realize how stupid it would be to just go walking around in public.  What i mean though is do not avoid medical attention because you are worried about insurance/ bills/money"

Instead, the toll outside of China still stands at 2 and it seems to be pretty contained. If anything, people on here are more worried now than they were a week ago when less was known. \n\nAm I missing something?\nThe only thing I'm worried about is poorer nations picking it up and epidemics starting there. As far as the spread goes now, has it even progressed beyond people infecting people after being infected by people from Wuhan (3 generations from patient zero)?"

He  lives in Texas and we live out of state. He has been really sick with  the flu ... like in bed all day sick. We speak on hangouts usually. well  this morning we get 3 calls from a medical clinic near his home asking  for our son regarding his dr. appointment. They said it was important to  talk to him because of protocal regarding the notes in the online  appointment app from their website. They gave us our sons birthday (he  is an adult) and said the online note said the appointment was regarding  Coronavirus and work related! So this clinic was kind of alarmed by the  message and wanted to set a protocal before he came into the  appointment. We asked who set up the appointment, explained that he was  not in contact with anyone who had the virus and that this made no  sense. They said the note on the appointments simply had his name, his  proper birthdate and the cell number which is my wifes number. I called  them again and asked when the appointment was made but they could not  see that information. So this is the crazy thing... my Dad and his wife  just came home from China. They were 200 miles from Wuhan... they came  home and are self quarantining for 2 weeks. My son is in Texas and has  had no contact with them but somehow there was an appointment made for  him at a local clinic regarding Corna virus. Does this sound strange to  anyone? The only conclusion I can come up with is that NSA is listening  to any calls of friends and family of citizens who have traveled back  from China lately. They are listening for key words from any  conversation from any family or friends who are connected to all of  these travelers. They heard that my son was sick with a fever and in  bed, from a conversation we had with him. I believe they made the  appointment (my son denied telling anyone that he was sick but us and  never went to the doctor). the clinic was was afraid our son would show  up and be exposed to the virus. So... does this sound crazy or what?  However, I think they gave our number on the form so they could hear us  discuss if he was actually sick or not. What do you think? any ideas? Is  NSA tracking all citizens who come back from China? Are they trying to  find out who is sick? Should we be more concerned about our rights?"

Here is the math \n\nTheoretically if we have 33k death and the CFR is 2% how many are infected and how many suspected cases could there be as a result? \n\nCrematory Math\n\n5 Days for 4 Hours = 20 Hours of Operation\n7 Days for 24 Hours = 168 Hours of Operation\n\nThat is 8.4 times the normal rate.\n\nA reasonable assumption range would be that all the crematories in Wuhan are operating at 4-8 times the normal rate.\n\nUnreported Death Math\n\nIf we assume 50-100 uncounted deaths per day, per crematory, we arrive at 1,200 to 2,400 unreported Coronavirus deaths per day .\n\nIf this has been going on for 2 weeks, the number of unreported deaths would be in the range of 16,800 to 33,600.\n\nNote: Wengui says there are 49 crematoriums in Wuhan. My calculation was based on 24 crematoriums, a number I picked up somewhere else.\n\nIf we redo the calc there are 2,450 to 4,900 unreported deaths per day.\n\nThat would imply 34,300 to 68,600 unreported deaths just in the Wuhan area over the last 2 weeks.\n\n[source](https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/wuhan-crematory-127-yesterday-this-is-4-5-times-normal-rate-202002092251)"

Maybe the virus has been around since October and that's why they ran the simulation. \n\nChina been trying to keep it quiet for the public till doctors realised theres alot of these coming in. So spoke out. \n\nWhich would definitely prove higher numbers and hopefully means they might of been working a vaccine for a lil longer. \n\nI dunno, Im just thinking out load really.

And it\u2019s dangerous considering 99% of people go no further than this and some, no further than the terribly misleading headlines.\n\n\u201cDeadly pandemic spread by droplets!\u201d \n\u201cPhotos from Wuhan look like a horror movie\u201d\n\u201cPeople dying in the streets\u201d\nOn and on. If it\u2019s not a complete over embellishment it\u2019s a headline that would also pertain to the yearly flu just as much as Caronavirus.\n\n20% truth inflated and twisted to be 100% attention grabbing. Normal media garbage yes, but doing this with something like this is just straight irresponsible. The media is causing undue panic. Yes the virus is serious, yes it can kill but it\u2019s not, based on the real info we have, anything that we need to be even close to panicking about.\n\nWith the information at hand at present it does look like it could be as bad as a very bad flu. And that\u2019s bad, but do streets empty during a bad flu season? Do people buy all the masks off the shelves?\n\nWorst case scenario here I see is this virus spreads globally, people panic, they get it themselves along with most people they know and they realise it was as all an over reaction being so panicked and scared. It means if the same thing happens again in a couple of years, with something having a mortality rate of 10%+ it won\u2019t be taken as seriously by the world population as it needs to because they\u2019ll remember the overreaction to the Coronavirus.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, this is to be taken seriously and it should be followed closely because it\u2019s still early days, but the media are inciting undue panic given what we do know as of now. They\u2019re even starting to report now on \u201cthe poor reactions of people to the Coronavirus scare\u201d.... you\u2019re causing this you fools!!\n\nThe TL:DR - find a coupe of non sensational Chanel\u2019s on YouTube and follow them for real info on the topic. You\u2019ll be less likely to panic and more likely to be educated enough to protect yourself as much as you feel you need to."

        "Text": "Honest question. Maybe it's because i'm not american, but i find the obsession some people seems to have with \"being prepared\" incredibly strange.\n\nWhat does that even mean? In case there is an outbreak, following standard public health protocols will be infinitely more useful than having kilos of non-disposable food in the cellar.\n\nWhen i read these posts, i get the feeling that many people actually expect some sort of societal collapse, which i find thoroughly wild. The worst case scenario in western countries is that the hospitals get overloaded and more people die because of that, stocking up on food won't change anything in that case.\n\nI'm in Austria, and while people are following the news and are aware of what's happening, nobody is stocking up on beans and rice. Nobody is worried that society will stop functioning and we'll have looters running around. The only people who truly need to \"prepare\" are the people who have to make sure the healthcare system can handle an influx of cases.\n\nMaybe it's an american thing, could be honestly. But it really seems like people are expecting civilization to collapse any day, when there is absolutely no reason to...\n\nEdit: Just for clarification, i'm not arguing that you shouldn't have some stuff at home. Far from it, you definitely should. I'm arguing against hoarding, and acting as if the world is about to end.\n\nI understand that people are scared, and that feeling as if you're doing something can make us feel better. But in reality, if there is an outbreak, following public health recommendations (like washing your hands, avoiding public gatherings etc.) is the stuff that will actually make a difference."

Not only the immediate disruption in daily-life activities with mass hysteria, people quitting their jobs, riots and strikes will happen. But also with investors in panic there will be a big instant sellout chaining into one of the biggest recessions in history. Businesses will shut down and people will lose their jobs. Industry and manufacturers will stop producing, and farms won\u2019t be able to catch up with the loss of supplies. Food and basic merchandise won\u2019t be in the stores for some time and when they do for a very limited time the prices will be at least 10 times higher. Public services as healthcare or police will be overwhelmed and shut down as they won\u2019t be able to provide any effective service. Martial law will be declared and military will take over the security in the streets and will manage the emergency healthcare attention to citizens. \n\nFear and chaos is what brings society down. Sometimes people are just not ready to absorb all the truth at once, it\u2019s better to provide it in small digestible doses. Don\u2019t blame them to laugh at your doomsayers warnings."

However, it is frustrating me that everyone is saying things like \"the Chinese deserve this\".\n\nI agree that the stuff SOME of them eat is wrong in most people eyes however they aren't all like that. A hell of a lot of my Uni friends are Chinese and all of them are just as disgusted as the rest of us as to what they eat and the way they act.\n\nI also agree that the government is very controlling and the do not have the rights they should. The HK protests is a great example of what is wrong with the Chinese government. But seeing hashtags like #chineseareterrorists on twitter is not okay.\n\nI think a lot of people on here see the disguising stuff that comes from these types of markets and are stereotyping all chinese. \n\nA lot of countries have some messed up people including the UK so stop blaming the whole of China."

They will likely be added to the case count, Dr. Messonnier said.\n\nSeveral Americans remain critically ill with the infection in Japanese hospitals. They were among the passengers aboard the Diamond Princess, which was overwhelmed with infections after it docked in Yokahama, Japan.\n\n\nAs of Friday, the coronavirus has infected at least 75,000 people, the vast majority in mainland China, and has killed 2,240.\n\n\u201cThis new virus represents a tremendous public health threat,\u201d Dr. Messonnier said.\n\nPlease check back for updates on this developing story.\n\n[US cases -NYTimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/health/coronavirus-cases-in-the-united-states-reach-34-and-more-are-expected.html)"

Also stockpiled lemons, ginger, and turmeric in freezer - enough for 2 doses/day for 15 days for 2 people. I also take wheatgrass shots but unclear if they actually help.\n\nRegimen accounts for cost-minimization (I'm sure there are more expensive regimens!), freezability of perishable food in the event of a run on grocery stores, and research on herbal medicine and minerals on immunity. \n\nWould be curious about what others are doing."

        "Text": "So please take this with a grain of salt, and understand I am not trying to say this is an official confirmed story.\n\nBefore I dive in to this, some background on China for those that do not know. So The Chinese themselves have said for a long time that their biggest problem keeping them from competing as a world superpower was their issues with overpopulation. This lead to the institution of the One Child Policy. This in turn caused for their to be many abortions of female children in favor of people wanting their singular child to be a male. This of course has caused there to be an unbalanced and large number of male Chinese nationals.\n\n**So, let's look at some facts.**\n\nFirst there was this study that came out of the Kusuma School of biological sciences, Indian institute of technology in New Dehli, India.\n\n[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871v1.full.pdf](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871v1.full.pdf)\n\nWhile I understand that this paper has been shot down by many skeptics, and me not being a virologist myself, I am not qualified to comment on it. But, in my unqualified OPINION and what many actual doctors have been saying is that this is evidence that the virus did not come from nature, and has been manipulated.\n\n~~Also there is the fact that the CDC is not sending out the RNA sequence for the virus, and maintain that they themselves must do all testing.~~ (Apparently the genome has actually now been shared)\n\nNext, we have the fact that people have been getting removed and banned from Big Tech sites- all of which have major ties to the Chinese economy- for even RAISING THE QUESTION that this might be man made.\n\nIf I still have not raised any suspicions, please read the New York Times article below that was published today\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/business/china-coronavirus-doctor-death.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/business/china-coronavirus-doctor-death.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage)\n\nThe highest risk group with regards this virus is Chinese males, as the infection statistics prove so. They are at much greater risk than Chinese women.\n\nWe also have the fact that we know that 14 of the \"Patient Zero's\" had no contact with the wet market that is suspected to be the source of the outbreak.\n\n[https://twitter.com/SenTomCotton/status/1222962874932453377](https://twitter.com/SenTomCotton/status/1222962874932453377)\n\nPerhaps I am making some ridiculous jumps in logic, and am over thinking this, but also, maybe, **just maybe**, there is something more sinister at play than a mutated coronavirus."

        "Text": "First and foremost I've got to say that I have no credentials in this field. I've never claimed to be an expert and I never will. I have some basic knowledge regarding mostly older outbreaks because I've studied them in my field. This post will mostly talk about my thoughts and why people need to \"relax\". I hate that word but it's quite fitting.\n\nIf you're still reading this I would like to say hello and that my english might be subpar but I'll try my best. Some of you might look through my history or even know me by name because I've been on here quite a bit since the outbreak \"began\". I'm mostly known as a \"anti-doomer\" if one could use that term. I've been called most things since I dont buy into the scenario about Corona being \"disease-x\" even though some experts say it might. I would also like to point out that I've been prepping since early days with masks, hand-gel, gloves, goggles and you name it. I've shown you two sides of the same coin and it's ok if you disagree with either side. I've never downplayed this virus but I'm not sure it's \"disease-x\" either.\n\nLast few days the sheer amount of misinformation and fearmongering have actually been insane. I dont know if people are bored, trying to stir something up or actually believe what they're writing but it has to stop. The last week or so I've given multiple people the chance to explain their thoughts behind a bold claim regarding for example how many people will get infected. People always give me the link to Marc Lipsitch and it's always with a smug answer like *Bruh, how do you not know about Marc?*. I've gotta say it's great that more people are aware of Marc Lipsitch but please **dont** stop reading when you've seen what you *want* to see. It's like some people need their daily fix for this virus and it's actually quite disturbing. This sub and others alike have become huge echo-chambers for bad news, good news may only be fake btw. If you actually had a interest in Marc Lipsitch you would've known that he talks about many different scenarios. Same with Marion Koopmans or other experts thats frequently talked about on this sub.\n\nI would say that the next problem is on par or maybe even worse then **choosing to be misinformed**, fearmongering. Many of you do not realize what a harsh and extremely bad climate you're creating by only pushing and/or accepting your narrative for how this outbreak will \"play out\". News from China is a good exemple for describing what I'm talking about. Bad news is always true and good news is always fake. Even though both news are from China and maybe even the same source people choose to believe what's pushing their \"agenda\". If you want to know what I'm talking about it's just to watch every bad number-update from China contra every positive number-update from China . My take on this? I choose to believe that this outbreak is really bad and something we all should be aware of but that good news might actually happen. If I dislike a source I would not start trusting them just because they start posting news about things I agree on. It's still the same shit source as when I didnt agree.\n\n**This sub need to become nuanced, yesterday if that could work. At this moment I would say that some, I could even say most of you are not better than what youre currently hating. Aint that a sad realization when you discover that youre doing the exact same thing China is doing according to you? You're literlly creating this echo-chamber by yourself. Only enabling discussion with people that share your mindset is wrong and not good for the climate we're in.**\n\nI've made my point and I'm not going to sit here and say what's right or wrong about different opinions regarding Corona. It's ok if you think this is the big one but please be informed while trying to explain why because we need a better climate on this sub. Maybe we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg, maybe we've already peaked, maybe it's true that warmer climate is good. We,**on this sub**, have no idea what's right or wrong. Stop feeling like you're **woke** and it's your duty to inform everyone (with mostly false information) about the horrors that's awaiting. I've never seen a good, well-thought post about why this should be \"disease-x\". The one's whom been trying is mostly wrong or just straight up false. Let's face it, most of you have no clue how r0 works, dont try to build your math around something you dont understand."

The WHO is, for better or for worse.\nThey are seeing this firsthand. Most of us simply aren't.\nStay safe, be calm, take some precautions and most of all, be kind!\n\nEdit: The RedCross has been annointed as overseers years ago for the WHO and have not been critical of their work. The WHO is comprised of a board of members with at least one member from every participating country and even others that do not actively participate. The WHO isn't a Chinese shill despite the rumors. It's a blanket organization comprised of representatives from all over."

And you know that all the people that died (in Italy) already had some serious health conditions.\"\n\nRight now in Italy we have 322 confirmed case and 10 death, with the news of the virus arrived in the South (before it was confined in North Italy) in Palermo there's a bit a panic around here.\n\nThat said all Ricciardi is doing is misinformation, it's true that all the people that have died for now were already sick and dying anyways, but it's NOT true that only the 3% dies. The mortality rate of an ongoing epidemic must be calculated by dividing the died by the the died plus the recovered\n\ndied/(recovered + died)\n\nonly this way we can have the right death rate, which btw is around 9% [source](https://ncov2019.live/data), if you calculate it using the infects of course you'll have a much lower percentage but you are including people that can still die.\n\ndied / (total number of the infected)     is a formula that can work only when the epidemic has already stopped.\n\nWith [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/f97uda/german_tourist_returning_from_northern_italy/) and the continuous misinformation I feel like we are underestimating it, ofc all putting aside the fact that we have no way to know the real situation in Africa.\n\nEventually sorry for the bad English\n\nEdit: another person died in Italy while I was writing this, total is now 11\n\nEdit 2: Source of the death rate formula: [https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/)"

Average day over day total cases increase was:\n- 51% in the first week\n- 24% in the second\n- 11% in the third\n\nThe rest of the world is also seeing declines but not at the same rate and week three actually saw the growth percentage higher in the rest of the world than China 14% to 11%. Obviously the gross impact is still so much greater in China with almost 3,177 new cases per day over the past week while the rest of the world averages only 34 new cases per day. More than half of last week\u2019s new cases came from the cruise ship. \n\nThe rate of increase in deaths  over the last 5 reports have all outpaced new cases after 10 straight days of flat or slower growth.\n\nThere is too little data to draw strong conclusions but perhaps the outbreak has crested and the worst is behind us, or perhaps it\u2019s a result of the amazing work being done by administrators and clinicians to contain the spread. Whatever it is let\u2019s hope the end is near for 2019-nCoV.\n\nEdit: for those asking for source, the data is in the situation reports located https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/\n\nAlso for those saying the drop is the result on how China counts I have no insight at all into how the data is gathered, I find it interesting and thought you might too. It is interesting for the those convinced of conspiracy that the trends between China\u2019s case reporting and those of the Rest of the world are very similar."

And im not talking about some grey area, up for debate, man flu. Im talking about projectile vomitting, shitting myself inside out, stuck in fever dellusions for days on end type of flu.  \n\n\nSo im instinctively very worried, its been around 11 years since I last had it and I dont want to have anything remotely resembling it again, ever.  \n\n\nSo having said this I sympathise with a lot of people here, who like me, feel not very many people in our social/family circles are taking this seriously, or making silly equivalents to flu season or other epidemics.  \n\n\nHowever, on the other side of the spectrum there are people here who are clearly getting a hard on over a potential apocalypse.  \n\n\nSo many people are being drawn to worst case scenarios, which is understandable, Im doing the same.   \n\n\nBut it's very easy to start slipping into the conspiratorial at this rate.   \n\n\nI mean these latest posts over 24K dead, please. Im not gonna say its bollocks but even with the videos and comments leaking out, 24K dead is a still a huge number of dead to keep secret.  \n\n\nI get the feeling some people are just looking for worst case scenarios just to have a \"told you so\" moment.   \n\n\nTbh im not in the slightest bit arsed making myself look like a tit to safeguard my family, even if there was an incredibly slim chance of it becoming a pandemic. But rushing to hyperbolic figures for a feel good \"I was right moment\" doesnt help anyone, least of all yourself.  \n\n\n....Unless of course you're engaging in some shrewd stock manipulation for personal gain in which case, the hyperbole probably would benefit you."

I\u2019m going to stop doing that! **Start using credit card exclusively.**\n\nWhen I fill-up my car with gas I first take some towels from the outside service rack. The place where you get the squeegee to clean your windows. I use those towels to interact with the pump computer and I **use those towels to grab the gas pump handle.** LPT - Grab some extra towels & keep them in your car.\n\n**Use those gas station towels when you open public doors** & then discard them.\n\nThose paper towels also come in handy when in the grocery store. **Use a towel when you first grab a cart.** Most grocery stores now provide sanitary wipes that you then can use after you chose a cart.\n\nWhen you\u2019re going through apples and pears & such, try not to touch too many of them. **Look for pre-packaged vegetables.**\n\n**Stop going out to eat.** Except the drive-through fast food.\n\n**Stop going to the bar.** Fuckin pig sty.\n\n**QUIT THE GYM NOW.** If you have automatic withdrawal for your monthly gym membership, try to obtain the cancellation phone number yourself and the name of the company in case they mess with your account.\n\nIf you\u2019re like me you are addicted to the sauna. Although the heat in the sauna kills most germs it's still good to take some precautions. Fill-up a used water bottle with tap water & take that into the sauna. Spray the boards where you are going to sit in case some guy\u2019s nutsack or asshole was directly on the wood. Use the same water in your bottle to spray on the hot rocks. **Don\u2019t use the public  ladle!** I sauna about four times a week and the Asian dudes are ALWAYS forcing themselves to cough & snort & hack. Alway been kind-of gross. DON\u2019T SIT DIRECTLY ACROSS from them. Sit next to them. Why take a chance.\n\n**Stop going to church.** The entire Sunday service is like a recruiting video for the COVID-19. Worship through the TV or computer monitor.\n\nWhen you sneeze or cough don\u2019t bury your face into your elbow. Sneeze openly. **Let the spray out into the air.** By covering your cough or sneeze you are actually driving the germs/virus into your clothing. In that way you may re-infect yourself at a later date. Plus you are bringing spores home which may infect your loved ones.\n\n**STOP shaking hands.**\n\n**STOP kissing.**\n\nI know these tips may not ever be necessary but just by practicing them you become more aware of yourself & your interaction with the world.\n\nLet\u2019s all **STAY SAFE.**"

At this moment, the coronavirus death toll stands at 1,370, and the number of confirmed active cases is 60,408. The press will take those two numbers and suggest that the death rate is 2.3 percent, and therefore lower than the 9.6 percent death rate of the SARS episode. But in order to calculate death rates, the denominator needs to be the sum of deaths plus cures, i.e., those who have completed the test. According to Worldometer, the number of cases with outcomes total 7,641 (1,370 deaths plus 6,271 recoveries/discharges), which suggests a much higher death rate of 18 percent."

As far as all of you mask hoarders go you do realize that buying up all of the n95 masks isn't really that helpful right? It only filters out up to 95% efficiency of particles that are .3 microns or larger. This virus is .12 microns  which means your mask will not filter it out.  So you probably should save your money and if you are really very worried just avoid crowded social situations unless you want to walk around with a full on oxygen tank,  but I think panicking here in the US is a little premature if you ask me. There is so much uncalled for fear on this thread.  Also by not hoarding the masks that probably won't do much for you anyway there will be less price gouging for people who actually need them."

It gives us a more accurate view of the virus and allows us to treat people better.

But numbers won\u2019t lie (when reported correctly)\n\n2020 Flu - 10,000 deaths (270 a day)\nHeart Disease - 1 every 37 seconds (sad realization)\nMalaria Deaths in 2019 - 584,000\n\nI can completely align with the fact it\u2019s tough to look at China\u2019s numbers as legit or factual. But for this I\u2019m going to use their numbers at this time \n\nTotal infected - 31,000 total deaths 636 total recovered 1563 recovered\n\nWe can\u2019t look at the infected at this time. We can only look at deaths and recovered for answers. \n\n2199 people have either survived or passed away. Right now the virus is showing a fatality rate of 29%. The estimate for people with the flu is 180,000 so far in the US. That\u2019s a 5% fatality rate. \n\nWhat I\u2019m watching right now are the infected outside of China. What will those numbers look like in 2-3 weeks. \n\nFor those of you concerned, you should be. For those brushing it off, that\u2019s wrong. I don\u2019t see Armageddon coming, but I don\u2019t see this not effecting the entire globe. \n\nPart of the reason the flu doesn\u2019t have a significantly higher fatality rate is cause of flu vaccines and years of evolution. The Spanish flu of 1918 took 50 million lives. Global population was 2 billion. That was 20% fatality rate. \n\nThere\u2019s 8 billion people on the planet now. The chances of 1.6 billion people dying from this is very slim. This is not 1918 and the response time is SIGNIFICANTLY better then back then. Not to mention there was a world war going on.  \n\nThe good news for everyone is people are fighting hard to stop the unknown. There is promise that a case was treated in 2 days and China is now testing it on 1,000 of their infected. \n\nDon\u2019t let fear drive you insane. Be prepared but enjoy your life. The chips will fall where they fall. Don\u2019t over think things. Don\u2019t bash those who are positive. Don\u2019t bash those who are negative. Hug your loved ones and love each day for what it is. Keep those sick and on the front line in your thoughts and prayers. In the end, life will find a way to continue on and you will all be apart of it."

R0? Mortality rates? \n* Why wasn't there as much blame towards the US for H1N1 as supposed to COVID-19 for China?  Is it really fair to say there was underreporting for H1N1 the way the rest of the world is accusing China for underreporting? \n* If indeed underreporting for H1N1, is the US repeating with the current outbreak?  What could be the rationale behind this - economic/business?  At the risk of a worse outbreak because majority of population won't be careful enough and aware?"

In recent times, production of natural latex has moved to Malaysia, Indonesia, and other Far Eastern regions. More than 90% of the total world production of natural rubber now comes from Asia, with well over half of that total originating in these countries.

I swear every aisle I went down there was a whole family of asians. I kept holding my breath when i walked by because I was sketched out. Im really not sure why all of a sudden theres so many asians in my town. I dont have a problem with it usually, it just seems like weird timing. Leaving I definetly felt bad that I was nervous around them. Obviously, not every asian is sick and I know that but still it was weird. Ive never had thoughts like that before about an entire race of people.\n\nEdit1: Recognizing and identifying the symptoms of fear are important for my personal development so I can react in a better way to situations like this in the future.\n\nEdit2: As pointed out by several commenters the feeling I had were more xenophobic than racist.

It seems like this disease is quite the monster in the way it incubates for so long, so people can spread it will they don\u2019t have symptoms . Also, it appears to be EXTREMELY contagious as well. Is it now a possibility that because they were unable to catch it, it will spread to almost everyone globally ? I\u2019m sure there isn\u2019t a single person out there who hasn\u2019t gotten a cold cough or flu. The problem here is , this has a much higher mortality rate than those conditions.\n\nIf this disease truly spreads everywhere , and it truly kills 6-7 percent of people who contract it, we are looking at hundreds of millions of deaths before this thing dies out if it ever does. Is this something that is a possibility now? Again, I do health care data analytics but from a clinical side, I have no idea how this virus works."

I guess his research project didn\u2019t come far.\n\nSecond, this guy who admitted that he has no medical or biological education but \u201ccan review and judge solid science\u201d. He postulated that europeans express less ACE2 (entry receptor of cov but has also other very important functions in blood pressure regulation). He cited some papers of his \u201csolid science\u201d. But... the papers did not talk about ACE2. They talked about ACE which is a different gene and it\u2019s genotype II. \n\nI mean it\u2019s fine. We all make mistakes. BUT DON\u2019T BE SO FUCKING BOLD IN YOUR CONCLUSIONS!\n\nThese people always pretend they are doing a heroic job for humanity and that they found something that MILLIONS of scientists haven\u2019t found although it\u2019s so obvious. And then, of course, this is all due to CCP interference. Stop this bullshit and be more humble. The second pseudo-scientist with his ACE2 theiry started a toxic discussion that fueled anti-asian racism and false feelings of safety in europeans. \n\nIt\u2019s just dumb and it makes the sociological aspects of an epidemic worse.

However, sequence data alone provides minimal insights to identify and prepare for future pre-pandemic viruses. Therefore, to examine emergence potential of circulating CoVs, **we built a chimeric virus** that encodes a **novel, zoonotic spike protein** in the context of a viable CoV backbone. This approach characterized the threat posed by SHC014-CoV spike in primary human airway cells, *in vivo*, as well as the efficacy of available immune therapeutics. Together, the strategy translates metagenomics data to help predict and prepare for future emergent viruses.\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26552008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26552008)  \n[https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm.3985)"

I live in Maryland, where at the time of this post there have been no confirmed cases. There was one suspected but it turned out negative. That was also (to my knowledge) in Baltimore. I live on the other end right outside DC.\n\nI have never been to China nor have I had close contact with someone I know has been to China. Although, I am a teacher that works with a wide range of diverse students. I guess it wouldn\u2019t be a stretch to say one of my students of Asian descent may have possibly had contact with a parent or something who had recently been to China? None of my students have recently been to China (that I know of)\n\nNow my symptoms:\n\nI have a cough and a sore throat (started Friday). I am losing my voice and my head feels congested, as well as headaches. I have not had a fever or shortness of breath. But I have had a consistent cough for about three days. It feels like a head cold right now, but who knows. I took off work today because it hasn\u2019t gotten better, and I\u2019m worried to spread whatever I have to students.\n\nI know you all here aren\u2019t doctors but everyone here seems well-versed in what\u2019s going on with the virus. My question is, is it even possible that I have Corona? Should I immediately get to a doctor and quarantine myself or just stay at home and rest?\n\nEDIT: Why am I getting put on blast for asking this?? Everyday on this subreddit I read that you can catch the virus when people are showing no symptoms and everyone saying it\u2019s going to spread like a wildfire. Either this is a serious concern or it\u2019s not"

But I wonder if it might also explain why some people in China present as asymptomatic, with very mild symptoms, while others die. There might be a dietary difference that is conferring a benefit.\n\nJust a speculation, my personal research interest is in other seaweed metabolites, the halogenated acetates, but there seems to be something worth looking into here."

My theory as to why the virus is spreading faster in East Asian countries is primarily due to how Asians eat. When dinner is served people tend to think of having their own plate. However, in Asia people like to eat together and when I mean together I mean straight up digging in together in the same pot. Spoons, chopsticks, and forks all going in the same pot or pan. I hope that this trend can slowly fade away and people can start considering the risk factors even when there is no outbreak."

Providing an immediate relief to the population will allow people to stay home and quarantine themselves. \n2. **Provide free treatment for Coronavirus.**  Currently there are people with symptoms that refuse to go to the hospital because its too expensive.  They will not react until they need to be hospitalized, and by that time, they have infected many and our medical systems will be overworked.\n3. **Hygiene education.**  People are stupid.  People in U.S. are laughing at people wearing masks. But also, a lot of people don't know how to properly use a mask and actually increase their chances of getting sick.  They don't know how to not cross contaminate themselves.  \n4. **Close public schools temporarily.**  Kids are gross.   They will end up bringing the virus home to many families if nothing is done.  \n5. **Prioritize supply of food to affected/quarantined areas.**  Military and volunteers should be called to keep the supply lines open and the grid up.  \n6. **Quarantine high density populations with spontaneous human to human transmission.**  If a native citizen shows up to the hospital with coronavirus, it means it has scattered everywhere in the city and small measures are useless.  Promise support, aid, and a constant food supply to keep people from panicking.  \n7. **Implement quarantines immediately.** Just do it, don't let 5m people escape from the city, like Wuhan for example, and make the situation much worst.  Keep other cities safe, and let other cities be able to function and provide support to those in need.  Promise support, promise food, but \"put the mask on yourself before you help others\"\n8. **Be more open and honest.** The Wuhan approach of keeping things quiet will not work with an armed population.  We need to trust the government.  Have live streams of what is going on, and keep the internet open.  If the internet is suddenly shut off, shit will hit the fan and riots will start.  We need trust and work through this together."

This is nothing compared to past outbreaks such as Ebola, which had a mortality rate of 50%, and SARS, which had a rate of 10%. Also, every year around 30,000 people die from the common flu, and a million people die from heart disease. You are more likely to die from the common flu than from coronavirus. Therefore, if you aren't scared of the common flu or heart disease, then you have no reason to be scared of the coronavirus. Another thing is that coronavirus seems to only be deadly for those with weakened immune systems such as elderly people. Therefore, even if you are infected with coronavirus, if you are young and healthy (most people on reddit), then you will most likely be fine. The worst thing to do is to panic and to blame China for everything as it can lead to discrimination and unnecessary anarchy. Right now, you should remain alert, but do not be anxious."

        "Text": "It has come to my attention that governments and their associated press around the world usually display two distinct and different stances when dealing with the COVID-19, and they go from one to another when certain criteria is met.  In turn, this stances cause some general reactions from the population which could proof undesirable. The two phases are as follow:\n\n**Phase 1 - The downplaying-denial phase**  \nThis is characterized by the following tactics by the government and media:\n\n* Downplaying the risks, either its severity or its transmissibility, by comparing it to other diseases like the flu or by using biased statistics\n* Low amounts of screening, walled behind very restrictive conditions to be met prior to testing\n* Great emphasis on reassuring messages, lack of specific and practical information, and diversion tactics, like focusing the problem on the mask shortages or the \"misinformation\". \n* Demotivating messages towards people who actually prepares for a potential outbreak, such as the ones that suggest not to prep or to stop buying masks.\n* \\[SOMETIMES\\] Underreporting of cases and lies about current status to artificially lengthen the duration of this phase.\n\nSadly, the Phase 1 response has proven incapable of dealing with asymptomatic carriers and a heavy amount of visitors from infected countries. This usually ends up with localized clusters of sustained transmission that can easily remain undetected under such circumstances. Their benefit while dealing with public panic is also debatable, since it's not uncommon to see some panic precisely because of the lack of clear information and decisive action. It also doesn't help preserve the economy during much time, and the long term problems might outweigh the supposed short term benefits.\n\nPhase 1 generally causes the following:\n\n* Initial false sense of security for the uninformed or misinformed population, which do normal life and thus help keeping the infection rates high.\n* Failure to take the precaution and care required to minimise any potential outbreak in both the general public and the medical team.\n* Failure to take the initiative required to prepare for the potential outbreak in both the general public and the medical team.\n* Confusion, fear of the unknown and even panic when seeing the discrepancy between events unfolding in other countries and the measures taken in such other countries compared to their own.\n* Erosion of trust in the government by those who actually keep themselves well informed, who don't understand the reactive approach to the issue.\n\nAfter the sufficient time has passed, a good amount of symptomatic people starts appearing at the local healthcare facilities. Sadly, by the time they do end up seeking help, it's too late for some people, which end up perishing. At that point, some countries are forced to admit reality and swiftly transition to Phase 2. Unfortunately, the value of honesty and the capacity to keep people in the dark vary greatly among different types of government and cultures, so not all countries do shift their focus.\n\n**Phase 2 - The OMG \"this was totally unexpected\" phase**  \nCharacterized by:\n\n* Heavy amount of screening, big quarantines, suspension of mass gatherings and events, closure of businesses, and general restrictions to life.\n* Errors and shortcomings caused by the rapid change of focus, which confuse everyone involved and causes even more panic.\n* \\[SOMETIMES\\] Admission of such errors and shortcomings and bad practices.\n\nOnce people has found themselves in the middle of such radical change, from one day to the other, they can react unexpectedly, potentially only causing even further chaos, confusion and anger.\n\nPhase 2 does seem to start giving signs of being actually effective in china, and I can only hope that is indeed true (regardless of the real numbers) but the price taken for staying too much in Phase 1 and switching rapidly to Phase 2 will be remembered by the world as a great failure.\n\nSadly, it would seem that most other countries are following the same shortsighted two-phase methodology, which may prove unreliable if it's applied in such countries and could backfire massively.\n\nMy humble suggestion would be a much more transparent and proactive approach to this situations, where the public has time to cope with the reality and its potential of change, instead of being directed as they are some kind of mindless herd, and then making that a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nGiving the respect and knowledge to the populace they deserve for being adults would probably allow for much more granular approach, and would synchronize the efforts of both the government and the population, potentially giving rise to synergistic effects."

Would we be better off to just stop the restrictions and allow the economy to function efficiently?\n\nFrom all accounts it sounds like quarantines and restrictions are ineffective at stopping the spread of nCoV anyway. Most people who are infected will be just fine and require no hospitalization.\n\nWorse, all these restrictions and quarantines may result in more deaths simply because we aren't producing enough supplies. Also, all the restrictions might cause a recession which itself could lead to deaths as lay-offs ripple through the global economy and people on the economic margins find themselves unable to purchase food or medicine at all.\n\nWould we better off just to end all restrictions and quarantines, allowing nCoV to do it's worst, but keep the economy humming on all cylinders so that we can deal with the consequences of the illness more effectively?"

Every Doctor I talk to Knows all about vaping and what it does to people. Well, the symptoms of vaping and the symptoms of the Wuhan Virus are Very Similar, YES? Okay. Well for the past week or 2, prior to grounding planes.

        "Comment Count": 32,
        "Text": "According to a senior U.S. scientist, evidence suggests a 90 percent probability that the Wuhan 2019-nCoV virus, which has resulted in the quarantine of more than 80 Chinese cities, originated as a result of a laboratory event. He has called for transparency and an urgent international response to solve the \u201ccurrent humanitarian crisis in China.\u201d\n\nIn an exclusive interview with E P O C H T I M E S, Dr. James Lyons-Weiler, CEO and Director of The Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge, an independent publicly funded not-for-profit organization in Pittsburgh, Penn., said since the outbreak of the Wuhan 2019 n-CoV coronavirus, he has been analyzing data from internationally shared databanks, and has concluded the strongest evidence for his conclusion lies with the Spike Protein (S-Protein).\n\nSpike Protein (S-Protein) Segment Very Different Than Any Other Coronavirus Sequence\nLyons-Weiler said, the coronvirus sequences from samples isolated from infected patients in Wuhan have very similar gene sequences overall in comparison to related coronaviruses, but the 2019-nCoV has a very distinct gene sequence encoding the spike proteins. Spike proteins are the tools with which these viruses penetrate and infect host cells. He found the Wuhan virus has a spike protein that is very different than the nearest coronavirus, and he considers that a paradox.\n\n\u201cWhy would there be such a low sequence similarity in just this one protein in this one lineage, unless it came from somewhere else. It doesn\u2019t make sense. The genetic differences in the spike protein from the rest of the genome really make the spike protein stick out.\u201d\n\nNon-Matching Gap Found In Middle Segment of the Virus\u2019 S-Protein\nLyons-Weiler feels the strongest evidence supporting a genetically engineered source for the Wuhan virus comes from a peer-reviewed article by Chinese scientists who first published the virus\u2019 genetic sequence.\n\n\u201cThe scientists in China had difficulties matching one subsequence [stretch of genome unique to 2019 n-CoV] to anything and were puzzled. They said it could have come from a recombination event that they speculated involved a snake because of a codon bias, but that theory has been rejected.\u201d A codon is a series of three nucleotides that codes a specific amino acid, and codon bias involves an overabundance in the number of codons.\n\n2019 n-CoV Unique Gap Sequence Matched to pShuttle-sn\nLyons-Weilers took that unique sequence and searched databanks for a possible non-viral source and found a significantly close match to pShuttle-SN, a recombinant SARS research vector spike protein that had been created in China.\n\nSince 2005, scientists in laboratories around the world have been experimenting with recombinant technology to make recombinant viruses. Chinese researchers have also patented an adenovirus-based recombined vaccine made using pShuttle-sn technology.\n\nHe said, \u201cIt would be very likely that we have very dangerous viruses in laboratories, the pathogenicity of which we know nothing about because we took a spike protein from SARS and put it into another virus.\u201d There have been at least four accidental releases of SARS coronavirus from labs in the region in the past.\n\nIs Wuhan Virus a Recombinant Virus Being Used in Vaccine Development?\nHe said, the connection to pShuttle-SN led him to postulate that perhaps the serious clinical disease resulting from 2019 n-CoV infection was the result of a secondary challenge with a SARS-like coronavirus in previously vaccinated populations.\n\n\u201cThe real reason we do not have a SARS vaccine is due to the atrocious mortality rates in animals [rats, ferrets and mice] associated with secondary exposure after vaccination with recombinant vaccines made with SARS spike proteins.\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cI am very concerned that the Chinese people might have been surreptitiously exposed to a SARS spike protein vaccine. There were Phase I clinical trials with SARS vaccines in China conducted in Wuhan. This is a testable hypothesis,\u201d he said.\n\nAt present, mortality rates outside China are much lower than inside China. In a few weeks, if mortality rates around the world remain low, it would support the hypothesis that a public with prior exposure to the SARS protein is developing severe disease after being infected with another similar virus. If mortality rates in the rest of the world begin to match those in China, then a global pandemic could have a high mortality rate.\n\nLyons-Weiler pointed out that \u201cthe disease progression of the 2019 n-CoV is exactly like that of the animals that were vaccinated with SARS spike protein-based vaccines that were given a secondary challenge with SARS\u201d and developed hypersensitized immune responses with a high mortality rate.\n\nThe hypersensitization-following-vaccine theory is lent credence by the fact that on Dec. 1, 2019, a new law went into effect making residents living in China legally obligated to be vaccinated with all state immunization program vaccines. The concern is whether there were larger human trials of a SARS vaccine in Wuhan than previously known.\n\nOfficial Chinese Position that Wuhan Virus is Natural Event \u2018Demonstrably Incorrect\u2019\nIn a Chinese language article published by Caixin in China, an unnamed Chinese Academy of Sciences researcher in the field of bioinformatics claims the Wuhan virus was not created in a laboratory because, they claimed, the coronviruses have no endonuclease recognition sites. Endonuclease\n\nrecognition sites are used in recombination experiments to insert new or modified sequences into viruses.\n\nThis, Lyons-Weiler says, is a \u201cdemonstrably incorrect\u201d claim. \u201cThe most likely source for Wuhan viral outbreak is a laboratory,\u201d he said.\n\nCall for Transparency and Immediate Action\nLyons-Weiler said, at a time of such a crisis and emergency, he doesn\u2019t want to point fingers but wants the crisis to be solved as soon as possible, as so many people\u2019s lives are at stake.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if this is a bioweapon, or an escaped thing from a lab or a natural virus, there is a huge humanitarian crisis in China. There is a short window of time where we can help China turn this thing around. Transparency and objectivity are very important. People are critically ill. People are dying!\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cRegardless of where this virus came from, all countries who have been experimenting with bioweapons and spike protein vaccines must be concerned. Every laboratory in the world that has been working on recombined coronaviruses needs to share all data with 100 percent transparency\u2026 an escaped recombined virus with a SARS protein from any laboratory in any country trying to develop SARS vaccines could have led to a similar disaster.\u201d\n\n\u2018A True Test for Humankind\u2019\nLyons-Weiler views the current situation as a test for the entire world and hopes the rest of the world can help China to get through this.\n\n\u201cEach individual life is important. We need to help China get it under control to help them and the rest of the world. We must act in an unselfish manner. This is a true test for humankind. We all need to pull together. True humanitarianism requires transparency. The rest of the world needs to act as if their own nations\u2019 fates depends on how China does with this,\u201d he said.\n\nWith over 20 years of expertise in genomic proteomic and integromic data analysis, Dr. Lyons-Weiler is the author of 57 peer-reviewed publications and three books, including one about the Ebola virus. Since the outbreak, Dr. Lyons-Weiler has written extensively about the Wuhan virus, and has published these articles: \u201cOn the Origins of the 2019-nCoV Virus, Wuhan, China\u201d; \u201cMolecular Epidemiology of Spike Protein Sequences in 2019-nCoV: Origin Still Uncertain and Transparency Needed\u201d; \u201c2019-nCov Vaccine Recommended Readings\u201d"

The flu is spreading through the US and Australia and no one gives a shit. But then another virus spreads in a foreign country and we panic despite the very low chance it will infect you. Its hell in china. NOT in Australia, Britain, USA ect. If we are going to panic about a virus shoudlnt we panic about one we may actually catch. Yes the Corona is more deadly than the flu (as ive been told) but the cornavirus isnt doing much in countires outside of china. You have a higher chance of dying from the flu than the coronavirus because you have a higher chance of catching the flu (at the current moment). I know theres a vaccine but it doesnt always work.\n\nEdit: when i look around (Sydney, Australia) i see almost everyone with a fricken face mask on. What i dont see are people with disinfectant walking around and i dont see nurses checking everyone, i dont see endless lines outside of hospitals, i dont see people deadly sick, i dont see abulances haulinf away people and i dont see dead people on the street. Im saying people are over reacting AT THIS STAGE"

Have a minor cough as well. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 started coughing recently, she thinks it's her allergies. My 2 year old son also started with a runny nose and a cough. He's gotten a little better though.\n\nIt just seems to me a lot of people are currently sick right now. Yes I know it flu season but this just seems to much for me. \n\nI'm aware they say you would of needed to travel to China or came in touch with someone from China to be infected. But what if that's not the case? Is there any chance this thing can be airborne and a lot more people currently have it and don't know it yet? \n\nI'm don't consider myself someone who trust my government very much but do you would think they would inform us Americans if there were more cases or do you think they would keep it under wraps to avoid panic? \n\nAlso if we were to contract this I know hospitals are out of the question. Are you better off just staying home trying to fight it off? \n\nThank you!"

With the people dying and lack of resources, I\u2019ve only seen mostly Chinese Americans trying to reach out and donate. While at the same time, when the Australian Fires broke out, there was so much more support (which is super awesome). But I\u2019ve seen more people donate to dumbfuck koalas than living people and doctors who are working nonstop to treat people.\n\nIf you can\u2019t donate, at least show empathy for the situation. All I\u2019ve seen is \u201coh this just affects old people\u201d we\u2019ll be fine. Those \u201cold\u201d people are people too. They have families and lives of their own.

Just seems like banning flights from china at this point is like using duct tape to patch a hole in a sinking ship.  With all these other countries seeing transmission it will be here soon and it will be spreading.  Unless they ban flights from all these countries currently seeing transmission, which would never happen,  it will be here."

Its obvious that if they go back to normal that they'll just get reinfected over and over again from international travelers.

        "Text": "Well this adds to the story about those 14 Americans who tested positive just as they were getting ready to board evac flights. As is well known the State Department apparently overruled CDC and said let the 14 on and let\u2019s do a containment for them best we can. \n\nTurns out, per article, Trump was not consulted on that decision and is unhappy.  As an aside, I am generally a Trump supporter (god forbid..:let the abuse begin) but I disagree with him on this and am a bit disappointed with his view.  I think state department was right to bring them back.  I think that with so many other likely infected people on the plane in addition to the 14, the addition of those 14 added little additional risk. \n\n[source ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/02/21/politics/trump-coronavirus-cruise-ship/index.html)\n\nQuotes: \n\n\u201cPresident Donald Trump became enraged with senior advisers this week when 14 Americans who tested positive for the coronavirus were brought back to the US from Japan after he had been told they would remain quarantined overseas, administration officials told The Washington Post.\n\n\u201cAdministration officials told the Post that Trump learned of the reversal only after the fact and complained that the decision might damage his administration's handling of the outbreak.\u201d"
